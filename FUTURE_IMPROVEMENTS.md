# Future Improvements of the Learn Morse Code app

Possibilities:
- Add these modes: 1) Letter to morse code; 2) Morse code to letter; 3) Sound to letter
- Finish frequency and phrase methods
- Add disclaimers for test labels in frequency and phrase methods so that people would know what to input. 

Refactor the code ðŸ™‚:
- Rename files (option1, option2 -> frequency_method, phrase_method) and variables
- pack_elements should be rewritten with variable so pack_non_info_elements could be avoided
