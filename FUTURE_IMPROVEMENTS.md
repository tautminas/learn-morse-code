# Future Improvements of the Learn Morse Code app

Possibilities:
- Add "Sound to letter mode".
- Add score calculation for practice modes.
- Add disclaimers for test labels in frequency and phrase methods so that people would know what input is expected.
- Make the app more beautiful (paddings, colours, other images).
- Add size limitations for inputs.

Refactor the code ðŸ™‚:
- Rename files (option1, option2 -> frequency_method, phrase_method) and variables (test_label)
- pack_elements should be rewritten with parameter so pack_non_info_elements could be avoided
