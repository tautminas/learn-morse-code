# Future Improvements of the Learn Morse Code app

Possibilities:
- Add sound to letter mode.
- Add points calculation for practice modes.
- Add disclaimers for test labels in frequency and phrase methods so that people would know what to input. 
- Clear answer in phrase_page after testing
- Add styles (paddings, colours).
- Add size limitations for inputs.

Refactor the code ðŸ™‚:
- Rename files (option1, option2 -> frequency_method, phrase_method) and variables (test_label)
- pack_elements should be rewritten with variable so pack_non_info_elements could be avoided
